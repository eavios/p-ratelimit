# Using Redis with `p-ratelimit`

Using Redis with `p-ratelimit` is optional.

If you use Redis, `p-ratelimit` can coordinate rate limit quotas across multiple servers, so that all of your servers, combined, do not go over your assigned quota.

## Basic usage

To use Redis, you need to:

1. Decide on a channel name.
2. Create a `RedisQuotaManager`.
3. Create a rate limiter, passing it the `RedisQuotaManager`.

### 1. Decide on a channel name

This will be used as the name of a Redis pub/sub channel. All servers that share a quota must use the same channel name.

### 2. Create a RedisQuotaManager

Construct it by passing in a `Quota`, the channel name, and an initialized Redis client.

> ⚠️  — **Special case:** If your Redis client doesn’t support the `client.duplicate()` function, you’ll need to pass an array of **two** initialized Redis clients. Standard Redis clients do support the `duplicate` function. But if you are using Redis Cluster, or `fakeredis`, or another specialty Redis client, you’ll need to initialize and provide two clients.

### 3. Create a rate limiter

Instead of passing a `Quota`, pass the `RedisQuotaManager` to it.

#### Example

```typescript
const channelName = 'my-channel';
const quota = { concurrency: 10, interval: 1000, rate: 50, fastStart: true, rateLowerBound: 20 };
const quotaManager = new RedisQuotaManager(quota, channelName, redisClient);
const rateLimiter = pRateLimit(quotaManager);
```

## How it works

For performance reasons, each rate limiter operates independently. No state is stored in Redis. Redis is only used as a pub/sub channel to discover peers.

Upon startup, a rate limiter pings the pub/sub channel with its own unique id. Each peer rate limiter notices that a new server has come online and replies with its own ping. Ping replies are only sent if a new, previously unknown, server is discovered. This minimizes the amount of network traffic and prevents ping storms.

In this way, each server becomes aware of its peers.

As a server discovers new peers, it recalculates its quota to be `Math.floor(1 / number of peers)` of the overall `concurrency` and `rate` quotas. s.

### Reclaiming quota from servers that go offline

If a server goes offline, the remaining servers decrement their count of known peers and recalculate the quota.

To do this, each server periodically sends an unsolicited ping (default: every 30 seconds). Peer servers keep track of the last time each server was seen.

If a server has not been seen for 3 consecutive ping periods (90 seconds), the other servers reclaim its quota.

## The `fastStart` option

If the `Quota` has `fastStart` set to `true`, the rate-limiter will immediately process API requests, up to the full quota. As peer servers are discovered, the quota is automatically adjusted downward.

If `fastStart` is `false` (the default), the rate-limiter starts with a quota of `0`. All API requests are queued and no requests are processed yet. After several seconds, when the rate-limiter has discovered its peers, its true quota is calculated and it begins processing the queued requests.

A `fastStart` value of `true` will begin processing requests immediately, but there’s a small chance it could briefly cause the shared rate limit to be exceeded. A value of `false` makes sure the limit is not exceeded, but your app may run slowly at first, as the first API calls may be delayed for a few seconds.

## The `rateLowerBound` option

If the `Quota` has `rateLowerBound` set to a value greater than 1, then when the rate-limiter recalculates the quota for each server it will guarantee that at least one server in the cluster has a quota of at least the `rateLowerBound` allowing for weighted process API requests. 

This allows you to use the rate limiter for scenarios where the API calls may have different quota costs and guarantee that at least one server in the cluster can serve request. The `rateLowerBound` value should be set to the highest quota cost value in the set of API calls.

Example:

| API Call weights | # of Servers  | Rate | RateLowerBound value  | Server quotas |
|------------------|---------------|------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| 100, 5, 20       | 2             | 110  | 100                   | 100, 10               |
| 1, 1, 1          | 4             | 10   |  1                    |  3, 3, 3, 1           |
| 4, 4, 4          | 3             | 5    |  1                    |  2, 2, 1                    |
